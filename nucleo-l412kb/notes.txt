Now running at 2.3 mA in RUN mode, but merely 290 uA in STOP2 mode.
I still can check to reconfigure all non used gpios as input floats, 
disable cleck in gpios from the outputs (and leave only the inputs).

Also, check which features do I need or I can remove, 
as the flash acceleration ACR,
if using or not the DMA,
how many things the VDD populates, 
disable FPU,
disable systicks,


Also, the microcontroller runs in STOP2 mode all time, even with
key holded. So its worth to optimize the STOP2 features and not 
bother too much with the Run features.

Check the LPUSART, is it worth to use it? or normal USART.


FLASH_ACR_LATENCY_4WS 
See manual RM0394: pag 79. For 16MHz in Vcore range 1, the Latency should be 0-wait-states!!!
And in the program is set to 4WS!!! probably because was set when using the PLL clock at 80MHz
With ART accelerator, the flash can be accessed with zero-WS even when the number of latency WS
is bigger than 1.
Maybe, for 16MHz, I can disable the prefetch bit PRFTEN, as the latency could be directly set to ZERO.
